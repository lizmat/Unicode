NAME
====

Unicode - provide information about Unicode versions

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use Unicode;
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

The `Unicode` class provided information about the (current) Unicode version supported.

It was introduced in Rakudo release 2023.02. It is provided here to allow the functionality to be used with older versions of Rakudo.

If Rakudo already supplies a `Unicode` class, then loading this module will effectively be a no-op.
